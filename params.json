Not [auto-generated :poop: from git commits](http://weblog.masukomi.org/2016/06/30/why-you-cant-auto-generate-your-changelog/).  \r\n\r\nIt encourages developers to create changelog entries at the correct level of abstraction, and it avoids the constant conflicts that would be generated my manually committing changes to CHANGELOG.md.\r\n\r\nFor more details, check out [the README](https://github.com/masukomi/changelog_manager#readme).
